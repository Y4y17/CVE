# Code Analysis

Locating the source location: /service-community/SRC/main/java/com/java110/community/cmd/ownerRepair/ListAdminOwnerRepairsCmd.Java

After debug code found problems in the cmd method, the code is as follows: int count = repairInnerServiceSMOImpl.queryRepairsCount(ownerRepairDto);
Continue to follow up:

This class is a hallmark of the work of Spring AOP. This class is not the original instance of the interface implementation class, but a Proxy object created by Spring. Here, a suspicious calling method was found in the Method. So, an attempt was made to set a breakpoint in this method. debug directly jumped to the next breakpoint, and it was discovered that the code directly skipped the Proxy and successfully reached the breakpoint

Then, in the above code, it can be seen that the bean is converted into a map collection, and then the queryRepairCount of repairServiceDaoImpl is called, and then it continues to follow up:

Once the corresponding SQL mapping file is found, just use namespace="repairServiceDaoImpl" as the file name to search for it:

After locating the specific file, directly search for id="queryRepairsCount" within the file. The content is as follows:

Among them, and t.epair_name like '%${repairName}%' is concatenated by ${}!
In Mybatis, ${} is directly concatenated! Therefore, there is an SQL injection vulnerability here!
